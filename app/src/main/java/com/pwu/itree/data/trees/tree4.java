The tree is widely exploited for its wood, which is traded internationally. A comparative newcomer to cultivation in plantations, as the only Eucalyptus species to grow in the humid rainforests, this species is now widely planted throughout the wet tropics of the world. Due to its very attractive bark and quick growth, the species is frequently planted as an ornamental tree.', " +

                "'This is the only species of Eucalyptus that is adapted to lowland and lower montane rainforest habitats in the humid tropics. It does not grow naturally in areas with a pronounced dry season but occurs in those where the annual rainfall is very high and the monthly rainfall usually exceeds 150 mm. It is found at elevations from sea level to 1,800 meters in areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 23 - 31°c and the mean annual rainfall is 2,500 - 5,000 mm. Plants are intolerant of frost. Requires a sunny position with full overhead light. Best growth occurs on deep, moderately fertile, well-drained, sandy alluvial loams with adequate soil moisture. Plants can grow successfully on coarse-textured sands and loamy soils, volcanic ash and limestone-derived soils. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7.5. The tree does not withstand prolonged flooding. The tree is highly sensitive to fires. Flowering may occur within the 1st year but more often it takes place after 2 years and annually thereafter. Flowering can occur in all months of the year, depending on the locality. The seeds are often dispersed by rivers. The flooding rivers in the wet season deposit the seeds mixed with humus on uncolonized alluvium in full sunlight. This constitutes ideal conditions for germination. Growth is usually rapid, the annual volume increment in plantations is 15 cubic m/ha, but occasionally it is as much as 50 cubic m/ha. At the age of 25 years, the trees reach an average height of 42 meters and an average bole diameter of 40 cm. The tree does not coppice vigorously. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation.', " +

It works well with hand and machine tools, although it has a slight tendency to tear out in machining and boring and to slight chipping of sharp edges in turning. The wood is useful for furniture, molding, flooring, construction lumber, boat building, veneer and plywood. The wood makes a strong sulphate pulp that can be bleached to a high brightness. Kraft pulping of the wood gives a yield of 50%, and a pulp of good brightness and satisfactory handsheet strength properties. The wood is also used for particleboard, hardboard and wood-wool board. Used to a limited extent for firewood and charcoal. However, it is normally considered too valuable for firewood. Trees more than 15 years old yield good charcoal.

The bole is typically straight and branch free for about half the height of the tree. Trees growing in the open have crowns with long, spreading, irregular and brittle branches, forming a dense canopy, whilst when growing in closely spaced plantations the branches are almost erect so that little crown spread occurs. In plantations in humid climates, some of the trees form aerial roots on the main bole as far as 6 meters above the ground. This species is one of the most widely planted Eucalyptus species, and it has been introduced into many tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate areas, including many countries in tropical Africa.', " +

It grows naturally at elevations up to 100 meters in areas where the mean maximum temperature in the hottest month is 30 - 32°c, and the mean minimum of the coldest month is about 3 - 5°c. Throughout its native range, from 5 to 10 light frosts occur each year. It has proved to be very adaptable in the tropics, where it can grow from sea level to elevations of 1,100 meters with a mean annual rainfall that ranges from 1,000 - 6,350 mm. Requires a sunny position. Succeeds on a range of soils, but prefers stiff clays and leached sandy loams. The tree is exceedingly tolerant to prolonged flooding, so it is extensively planted in swampy areas and along rivers. Tolerant of very acid soils. Trees start flowering when they are 3 - 5 years old. Seed dispersal is mainly by wind. The tree regenerates freely, and dense thickets of saplings can be found near old stands. A fast growing tree, it has reached a height of 27 meters in 15 years from seed in tropical plantations. The annual growth in height is usually 1.8 - 2.4 meters during the first few years, slowing down to 1.5 - 1.8 meters later. The plant grows well in plantations on good sites, but because of its ability to grow on both poorly drained and draughty locations, it is usually planted on adverse sites. It regenerates in areas flooded with fresh water, and its roots appear to be able to penetrate the heavy clays found in these conditions to reach the aerated soils below. The growth habit also helps it to establish on difficult but not necessarily flooded soils in localities widely different from its normal habitat. The tree can send out aerial roots from its trunk. Plants coppice well up to the age of 25 years.', " +

The essential oil yield from the leaves is 1.7%, with the characteristic constituents being piperitone, rho-cymene, linalool, 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, citronellyl acetate and alpha-terpinol. The heartwood is pale red when freshly cut, turning orange-red or red-brown with age; it is clearly demarcated from the up to 5cm wide band of pale brown sapwood. The grain is interlocked, texture coarse. Quartersawn surfaces sometimes have a ribbon figure of light and dark stripes. The wood is fairly heavy, moderately hard, strong, durable and able to be used in moist conditions, resistant to attacks by fungi and most insects, including marine borers, and moderately resistant to termite attack. The high shrinkage, coupled with the interlocked grain, means the wood requires careful drying. During drying distortion and splitting may occur; serious degrade can be avoided by air drying to a moisture content below 30% before kiln drying. The wood is not stable in service. The wood works well and takes a good polish. It is somewhat abrasive, and planing may be affected by interlocked grain. Therefore, slow speeds and a cutting angle of 20° are recommended. Sawing and working properties are generally good, although gummy exudates may clog up saws. The wood holds nails well, but pre-boring is necessary to avoid splitting. It turns well, and paints and waxes satisfactorily. Gluing is fairly difficult. The wood is not suitable for steam-bending. It is used for general construction and for poles, fencing, and wharf and bridge work. Other uses include pallets, house siding, flooring, ordinary furniture, interior trim, and panelling. Because of its strength and durability, it is also commonly used for mine props, railway sleepers, fence posts, stakes and gates. The stakes last a long time in the ground and can be driven repeatedly without splitting. The timber is also used for pulpwood, but the pulp is dark reddish-brown and is not as good for this purpose as some other species of Eucalyptus.

When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -5°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c. It can also tolerate low to moderate rainfall levels though, for good fruiting, it requires at least 1,000mm per annum with a clear dry period to allow its fruit to ripen.  It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 3,000mm, but can tolerate 400 - 5,000mm. For maximum production in the tropics it requires rainfall distributed over the year. If fruit ripens during a very wet period it loses flavor and may split. Prefers a fertile, moisture-retentive soil and a sunny position. Plants are tolerant of a range of soil conditions. Moderately tolerant of saline soils. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4 - 8.5. The plant is more drought-resistant than most tropical fruit crops. The guava often escapes from cultivation and is considered a noxious weed in many tropical pasture lands - its proliferation may result in the abandonment of a pasture. There are many named varieties, selected for their superior fruit forms. Plants have some deep roots, but do not form a taproot. The trees flower all year round. Seedlings may flower within 2 years; clonally propagated trees often begin to bear during the first year after planting. Trees reach full bearing after 5 - 8 years, depending on growing conditions and spacing. The guava is not a long-lived tree (about 40 years), but the plants may bear heavily for 15 - 25 years.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 28°c, but can tolerate 16 - 33°c. It can be killed by temperatures of 0°c or lower. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,300mm, but tolerates 1,200 - 3,000mm. Although it is not drought-tolerant, the plant grows best in areas with a fairly long dry season. Prefers a sunny position but also succeeds in light shade. Succeeds in a variety of soils, preferably well-drained.  The plant requires a reliable water supply and is often planted along streams or ponds. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7.5, tolerating 5 – 8. Seedling plants commence fruiting when about 5 - 6 years old. There are definite flowering seasons, often two, sometimes three in a year, but the timing varies from year to year.
