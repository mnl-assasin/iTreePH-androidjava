The flowers are small, actinomorphic or zygomorphic, and commonly functionally unisexual, although a given individual may bear seemingly bisexual flowers together with either male or female flowers. The perianth typically is biseriate, consisting of calyx and corolla. The calyx comprises 4 or 5 distinct or sometimes basally connate sepals. The corolla consists of 4 or 5 distinct petals or sometimes is absent. The petals commonly have basal appendages on the inner side. The stamens are distinct, often have hairy filaments, and in quantity usually are equal to or twice the number of calyx lobes. The gynoecium consists of a single compound pistil of usually 3 carpels, commonly an equal number of styles or style lobes, and a superior ovary usually with 3 locules, each containing 1 or 2 axile or axile-apical ovules.
