                "'The subfamily Faboideae, also called Papilionoideae (classified as a family, Fabaceae or Papilionaceae, by some authorities), is the largest group of legumes, consisting of about 475 genera and nearly 14,000 species grouped in 14 tribes. The name of the group probably originated because of the flowers resemblance to a butterfly (Latin: papilio). It is the unique bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic) flowers that especially characterize the group, so that thousands of species can be recognized as a member of Papilionoideae at a glance. The Lathyrus odoratus(sweet pea) flower provides an example. It has a large petal at the top, called the banner, or standard, that develops outside of the others before the flower has opened, two lateral petals called wings, and two lower petals that are usually fused and form a keel that encloses the stamens and pistil. The whole design is adapted for pollination by insects or, in a few members, by hummingbirds. Sweet nectar, to which the insects are cued by coloured petals, is the usual pollinator attractant. Various locking and releasing devices of the keel and wing petals control pollination in diverse ways favouring (or enforcing) either outcrossing or self-pollinationâ€”e.g., Trifolium (clover), Medicago (alfalfa), and Lotus corniculatus (birds-foot trefoil). The most effective kind of obligate self-pollination, however, is that of cleistogamous flowers, which do not open and thus prevent the entry of insects. Lespedeza and many other genera of Papilionoideae legumes bear both kinds of flowers, generally on the same plant. Enforced inbreeding serves to fix and maintain successful strains; outbreeding provides evolutionary diversity that may facilitate habitat or range expansion or may serve to provide flexibility for environmental changes.', " + R.drawable.family_fabaceae_faboideae));

A very valuable multipurpose tree and important component of various agroforestry systems, the tree is often cultivated in many tropical countries of Central and South America, S and SE Asia, the Pacific islands and Africa. It serves as a pioneer species to establish the site, as a shade and support tree; as a green manure and forage crop in plantations; it is used for the establishment of living fences etc. The plant is often grown as an ornamental, where it is particularly valued for its generosity in flower - its arching branches being weighed down by the densely packed racemes of nectar-rich flowers.', " +

                "'A plant of the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,600 meters. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 30°c, but can tolerate 12 - 44°c. Mature plants can be killed by temperatures of -2°c or lower, but young growth will be severely damaged at -1°c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 2,300mm, but tolerates 600 - 3,500mm. In its native range the climate is relatively uniformly sub-humid with a five-month dry period, though it can also grow successfully in more humid zones without a marked dry season (though it does not set seed then). Grows best in a sunny position. Tolerates a wide range of soil types, both alkaline and acidic, including low-fertility soils. It grows well on the calcareous soils of atolls. Prefers freely draining soils but can tolerate some waterlogging. Plants establish well on steep slopes with up to 40% gradient. As an aggressive coloniser, the plant has the potential to become a weed but is rarely so perhaps because it in most places is coppiced regularly and not permitted to set seed. A fast growing tree, capable of increases in height of 3 meters or more per year, though early seedling growth is quite slow. When grown as a fuel crop, the first harvest can be taken after 3 - 4 years, giving wood yields of 8 - 15 cubic meters per hectare. Subsequent coppicing is done every 2 - 3 years and yields may be 11 - 21 cubic meters. Gliricidia is often exposed to annual fires in its native, seasonally dry habitat. It tolerates such fires well and trees quickly resprout when the rains start, which explains the abundance of the tree in secondary vegetations and fallows. There is a predictable relationship between the flowering of the plant and the onset of the rainy season in Venezuela, making it a promising indicator species. In many parts of the naturalized range and where it is an exotic, flowering can occur any time of the year if there is no pronounced dry season. Pod-ripening time ranges between 35 and 60 days. Pods can grow to full size within 3 weeks of fertilization. On maturity, pods dehisce explosively; tension builds up in the pod valves and the seeds are ejected to a distance of 25 meters. This phenomenon facilitates rapid establishment, especially in disturbed sites, and also means that in some areas the plant has become invasive. Wind plays a part in the direction of seed dispersal. Secondary dispersal by rain is also possible. Pollarding at 2 meters or above is recommended for optimal wood biomass production. Coppicing is used where the primary objective is fuel wood production. The plant has been shown to tolerate lopping and browsing. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby.', " +

The texture is coarse; the grain is irregular and close. The wood is hard, heavy, very tough, very durable in contact with the soil and termite resistant. It is difficult to split and takes a very good polish. The wood is utilized for railway sleepers, farm implements, tool handles, furniture, house construction and as mother posts in live-fence establishment. The wood is often used for fuel and charcoal production.

A multipurpose tree, it is particularly valued for its oil and also supplies dyestuff, wood, fuel, insect repellent, medicines and various other commodities. The tree is planted in the humid tropical and subtropical lowlands around the world as a pioneer and soil reclamation plant. This species is one of the few nitrogen-fixing trees to produce seeds containing oil, and these are collected in vast amounts in India for commercial processing of industrial uses. The tree is often planted in homesteads as an ornamental tree and in avenue plantings, roadsides, and along stream and canal banks.

Mature plants can tolerate light frosts. The plant can grow on most soil types. The best growth is found on deep well-drained sandy loams with assured moisture, but it will also grow on sandy soils and heavy swelling clay soils.  It does not do well on dry sands, although it tolerates saline conditions, alkalinity and waterlogged soils. Tolerant of shade, it can grow under the shade of other trees, but will also grow well in full sun. Established plants are drought resistant. Plants are wind-resistant, tolerating at least some salt-laden air. Plants become nutrient deficient if growing in soils with a pH higher than 7.5. The plant has a long, thick taproot and widely spreading lateral roots. The spread of roots on this species, about 9 meters in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely. Because of these characteristics, pongam is unsuitable for agroforestry and has the potential to become a weed if not managed carefully. Pod production commences when seedlings are 5 - 7 years old. The pods do not open naturally, and must decay before the seeds can germinate. Individual trees yield 9 - 90 kg of pods annually, while mature trees yield 8 - 24 kg of seeds annually. Growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 meters in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months was recorded in India. Trees coppice well and can also be pollarded. When planted as a shade or ornamental tree, pruning may be necessary to obtain a trunk of appropriate height.

Under favourable conditions, trees in Singapore have been known to grow an average of 33 meters in height and 1.55 meters in girth in 11 years, or an average annual increment of 1.2 meters height and 14 cm girth. Open-grown trees usually begin flowering and fruiting between 5 and 10 years of age. Plants can flower and produce fruit all year round. The roots can become quite large and grow near the surface, the tree should therefore be planted several meters away from sidewalks and other structures. Seedlings are slower growing than cuttings and exhibit considerable variation in vigour. A strict culling program would be necessary to ensure that only the best stocks are planted out. Rooted cuttings can be established readily on nearly all kinds of soils, from coastal sands to inland clays, in urban and garden situations, and even in quite small planting holes dug into pavements. However, establishment trials in forest areas have had mixed results and some have failed. The reasons are not clear. Trees of all sizes and ages easily regenerate new shoots when lopped or pollarded. In Papua New Guinea, logged forest trees readily regenerate new plants from the roots.
