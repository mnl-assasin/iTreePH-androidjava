In that sense it is not a true monophyletic group, and it will undoubtedly be treated taxonomically in a different way in the future. Caesalpinioideae legumes are found throughout the world but are primarily woody plants in the tropics. Their moderate secondary invasion of temperate regions is mostly by herbaceous (nonwoody) evolutionary derivatives.
