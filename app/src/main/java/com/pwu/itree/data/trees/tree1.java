It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 35°c, but can tolerate 12 - 38°c. The plant is quite tolerant, though, and succeeds in southern China where there are light frosts and mean daily temperatures can drop below 10°c for weeks on end.  It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 8,000mm.  Optimally, there should be at least 150 mm of rain each month of the year, ideally falling mostly at night. Plants grow well in full sun, even when small. Grows and thrives on wide range of tropical soils, provided they have adequate water supply. Requires a humus-rich soil. Waterlogged, highly lateritic, extremely sandy, stony or peaty soils should be avoided. Tolerant of temporary flooding, provided the water is not stagnant. The root system is adventitious, forming a dense mat with a radius of 3 - 5 meters in the upper 40 - 60cm of the soil. Some primary roots are directly below the base of the trunk descending for anchorage for more than 1.5 meters, the roots produce pneumatodes under very moist conditions. The African oil palm is a succession species favoured by slash and burn, and its gene pool has expanded as farmers clear land and create more open habitat for the germination of its seeds. Plants can commence bearing just 3 years after the seed has germinated. The plant produces both male and female flowers, but not usually at the same time. An individual inflorescence will be all male or all female flowers; after a series of inflorescences of one sex the plant will then produce a series of inflorescences of the opposite sex. ', " +
                "'Two types of oil are obtained from the plant. Palm oil is obtained from the fruit. About 10% of all palm oil, the inferior grades in particular and also refining residues, is used to manufacture soaps, detergents, candles, resins, lubricating greases, cosmetics, glycerol and fatty acids. Palm oil is employed in the steel industry (for sheet-steel manufacturing and tin plating, where it protects the iron before the tin is applied) and epoxidized palm oil is a plasticizer and stabilizer in PVC plastics. Palm kernel oil, obtained from the seed, is a non-drying oil. It is used as an alternative to coconut oil in making high quality soaps, as a lubricant etc. It is a source of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. These acids are chemical intermediates in the production of fatty alcohols, esters, amines, amides and more sophisticated chemicals, which are components of many products such as surface-active agents, plastics, lubricants and cosmetics. Both oils also have a wide range of other uses, including making detergents, shampoos, cosmetics, lubricating oil additives and fluxes. It is technically possible to produce from palm oil either carbohydrates for conversion to alcohol or a methanolizable oil as a diesel substitute. In Togo, the pressed fruits are dried and fashioned into cakes for cooking fuel. The empty bunches, fiber and also the effluent (0.5 t sludge for each t of milled fruit bunches) from the oil mills can be converted into products such as organic fertilizers. Palm fronds are useful for thatch. The entire palm fronds of this species are less suitable for thatching than those of the coconut palm, because of irregular leaflet insertion. However, the leaflets are often woven into baskets and mats; the leaflet midribs are made into brooms and the rachises used for fencing. Young leaflets produce a fine strong fibre, used for making fishing lines, snares and strainers. The seed shells are polished and carved into ornamental rings and beads. Palm trunks, available at replanting, provide excellent material for paper and board production, but this has not yet attracted much commercial interest. The seed shells are much appreciated by local blacksmiths as a high calorific fuel for furnaces. ', " +

                "'description Date palm is a single-stemmed, evergreen palm tree growing 15 - 40 meters tall. The unbranched stem is topped by a terminal crown of 100 - 120 leaves that can each be 4 - 7 meters long on a short stem up to 50cm long. The date palm is one of the longest cultivated plants in the world, having been grown at least 5,000 years ago. It is an enormously important crop in many dry tropical and subtropical areas, where its fruit often forms a staple food for long periods of the year. The plant is also widely exploited for many other purposes and, outside its natural arid zone, is commonly grown as an ornamental even though it may not fruit. ', " +
                "'The tree has been cultivated for so long that it is not known in a truly wild situation. ', " +
                "'Date palm is a plant of drier areas in the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,500 meters. Hot dry conditions are required for free fruiting, the fruit not forming very readily in cooler or moister climates. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 45°c, but can tolerate 10 - 52°c. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -15°c, but the leaves and young growth can be severely damaged at -4°c.  It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 200 - 300mm, but tolerates 100 - 400mm. The tree transpires large quantities of moisture and the amount of available rainfall is often little, or entirely absent in the production areas. The water requirement of the palm must be provided for by ground water (the roots of the tree can reach 2 - 6 meters deep) or by irrigation. Plants are tolerant of a range of soil types, so long as they are well-drained.  Plants grow well in full sun, even when small. Tolerant of salty soils, though fruit quality might be adversely affected. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 8, tolerating 6 - 8.5. Seedlings begin to develop a stem when about 4 - 5 years old and will usually start flowering soon afterwards. Plants propagated from suckers can commence fruiting within 2 - 4 years and normally reach full production at 5 - 8 years, although productivity may increase up to 9 - 15 years. Pollination is critical for good fruiting; therefore, pollen is usually artificially introduced to the female flowers by cutting a male inflorescence and placing it strategically within a female inflorescence - this may be thinned a little to accommodate it. It is important that male trees are planted with females in ratios of about 1:50 in order to provide sufficient pollen. An average well-managed palm can produce about 60 - 70 kilos of fresh dates per year. Commercially, yields of dates are often restricted to about 50 kilos per tree in order to ensure high quality, though yields of 100 kilos have been recorded. Yields decline after 40 - 50 years, but the tree will continue to produce until about the age of 75 years. When fruit yields are poor, the tree is often tapped for its sap. The yield varies with management and site conditions, but it is in the range of 4 - 8 liters per day. There are many named forms. 	A dioecious species, at least one male plant for every 6 females is necessary to ensure fertilization. ', " +
                "'The leaves are widely used for a variety of purposes. They make an excellent thatch, being used to make roofs and walls of huts. A fiber obtained from the leaves, base of the leaves and bark can be used to make ropes, baskets, hats and mats. A fiber obtained from the leaf petiole, combined with other suitable material, is used for making insulating boards. Dried leaves, with their stiff, woody rachis, are used for fencing. The wood in the outer portion of the stem is strong and resistant to termites. It is much valued for use in construction. The stems are used for fuel. ', " +
