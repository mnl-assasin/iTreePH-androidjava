The majority of Mimosoideae have large leaves that are divided into secondary (compound) leaflets, and in many these leaflets are again divided (bicompound) and have a feathery, sometimes fernlike appearance. A striking exception is that of most of the Australian acacias (but not of the American kinds) mentioned above, in which the compound leaves have become modified, losing all their leaflets and appearing to be undivided, or simple. The flowers of the family are radially symmetric and are usually most easily recognized by the long stamens that extend beyond the rest of the flower. The calyx and corolla are both valvate in bud, contrasting with the usual condition in both of the other subfamilies. The petals are small and often not noticed except by close examination. Many of these plants have nodules containing the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium on their roots.', " + R.drawable.family_fabaceae_mimosoideae));

It grows well only in subhumid or humid climates with moderate dry seasons of up to 6 - 7 months. Prefers a well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerant of a range of soils, including limestone, wet and dry soils, soils of volcanic origin and those with moderate levels of salt. Plants are very tolerant of drought and of salt-laden winds. 	This species is an aggressive colonizer of ruderal sites and secondary or disturbed vegetation. This has been attributed to its precocious year-round flowering and fruiting, abundant seed production, self-fertility, hard seed coat, and ability to resprout after fire or cutting. It is now naturalized and weedy in many areas such as open (often coastal) habitats, semi-natural, disturbed, degraded habitats, other ruderal sites, and occasionally, agricultural land where it has been planted as a shade tree over cacao. Plants are deep-rooted. Plants respond well to coppicing, soon producing dense regrowth. Tolerates fast fires and can regrow after being burned to the crown by slower fires This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen.

The gum has been analysed and found similar to gum arabic, and of potential commercial value. Red, brown and black dyes are extracted from the pods, leaves and bark. The dried seeds are widely used for ornamentation. The heartwoos is a light reddish-brown; the sapwood pale yellow. It is medium textured, close grained. The wood is strong, hard and heavy (about 800 kg/m), of medium density. It is easily workable for a wide variety of carpentry purposes and dries without splitting or checking. Sawn timber, mine props, furniture and parquet flooring are among increasingly popular uses. However, the use of L. Leucocephala for sawn timber is greatly limited by its generally small dimensions (usually not greater than 30cm diameter), its branchiness, which limits lengths of clear bole available and means wood is often knotty, and its high proportion of juvenile wood. Nevertheless, there is growing use of small-dimension sawn wood in a number of industries such as flooring, which might include L. Leucocephala in the future. Poles are used to prop bananas and as a support for yams, pepper and other vines. Use of short-rotation L. Leucocephala for poles is limited by their lack of durability and susceptibility to attack by termites and woodborers. The wood is commonly pulped for its fiber, used to make paper. The fibre values are similar to those of other tropical hardwoods, and it produces paper with good printability but low tearing and folding strength; the wood-pulp strength is greater than that of most hardwoods, with almost 50% greater ring crush. Its pulping properties are suitable for both paper and rayon production. Also used for particleboard production. An excellent firewood species with a specific gravity of 0.45-0.55 and a high calorific value of 4600 cal/kg. The wood burns steadily with little smoke, few sparks and produces less than 1% ash.
