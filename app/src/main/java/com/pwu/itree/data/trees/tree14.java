Lamiaceae is distributed nearly worldwide, and many species are cultivated for their fragrant leaves and attractive flowers. The family is particularly important to humans for herb plants useful for flavour, fragrance, or medicinal properties. The alternate family name Labiatae refers to the fact that the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (labia in Latin). The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.', " + R.drawable.family_lamiaceae));

It can be unbranched for 6 - 10 meters. The tree is harvested from the wild for local use as a food, medicine and source of materials. The wood is of very good quality, it is used locally and also frequently traded. The tree has suitable characteristics for agroforestry, with fast growth, ease of establishment, and relative freedom from pests outside its natural range (it can be browsed repeatedly without damage). It is an especially promising fuel wood species because it can be established easily, regenerates well from both sprouts and seeds, and is fast growing.  It has been introduced as a plantation species in many countries, and large plantations are found in South-East Asia, West Africa and South America. It is also often grown as an ornamental, being planted as an avenue tree. ', " +

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 34Â°c, but can tolerate 16 - 46Â°c. It can be killed by temperatures of 1Â°c or lower.  It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,500mm, but tolerates 750 - 5,000mm. Requires a sunny position, even when young. Grows on many soils from acidic laterites to calcareous loams, but doing poorly on thin or poor soils with hardpan, dry sands, or heavily leached acidic soils, well-drained basic alluviums.  It does not thrive where the drainage is poor, while on dry, sandy or otherwise poor soil it remains stunted and is apt to assume little more than a shrubby form because of repeated dying back through drought. Established plants are drought tolerant. A very fast growing tree, it can reach 3 meters in height within its first year from seed and 20 meters within 4 - 5 years. The first flowers are borne 3 - 4 years after planting. Annual fuel wood production potential is 18 - 35 cubic meters per hectare. The tree has a lifespan of about 40 years. Trees coppice well with vigorous shoot growth. Plants can resprout after forest fires. Seed years recorded from various locations show that the tree seeds well every year. There are 2 peak periods for floral bud burst, which may vary from year to year, and with the local climatic conditions. In nature, self-pollination is discouraged by the floral morphology. However, in controlled self-pollination, flowers develop into fruits. Mature fruits are produced 1 week after the flowering peak and fruiting may be spread over a 2 month period. Although able to compete with weeds more successfully than many other species, it responds positively to weeding and also benefits from irrigation. Flowers produce abundant nectar, which produces high-quality honey.', " +

The wood is light in weight; soft to hard; very strong, susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites but said to be durable under water. The natural durability of the wood is about 15 years. It seasons well without degrading, but it is slow to dry both in the open and in a kiln; once dry it is moderately stable to stable in service. It saws easily and has only slight blunting effects on tools; it planes to a smooth finish; polishes well; when knots are present the cutting angles should be reduced; it is too soft for satisfactory turning; nailing is fairly easy, but pre-boring is recommended for screwing as the wood tends to split. Rotary peeling and slicing are easy even without pretreatment, and the veneers are easy to handle without a tendency to tear; they remain flat during drying.

The bole, which can be unbranched for up to 15 meters, is up to 1 meter in diameter and is often buttressed and may be fluted. In seasonal climates, the tree is deciduous, whilst trees grown in non-seasonal climates are semi-deciduous. Teak is one of the most important timbers in the world - a rare combination of superior physical and mechanical properties makes it a paragon of timber, and there is no likelihood of it being eclipsed by any other. It is widely planted for timber in the tropics. Teak is often grown in botanical gardens and is occasionally cultivated in tropical countries as an ornamental for its large leaves and spreading flower clusters.', " +
                "'Occurs naturally in various types of tropical deciduous forests.', " +
                "'A plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations from sea level to 1,200 meters. It is able to survive and grow under a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions, but grows best in a warm, moist, tropical climate with a significant difference between dry and wet seasons. It is found in areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 14 - 36Â°c. The tree can be killed by temperatures falling down to 3Â°c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall: of 1,200 - 2,500mm, but is able to succeed with as little as 600mm, or as much as 4,000mm. Requires a sunny position. The most suitable soil is deep, well-drained, fertile alluvial-colluvial soil with a pH of 6.5 - 8 and a relatively high calcium and phosphorous content. The quality of growth, however, depends on the depth, drainage, moisture status and the fertility of the soil. Teak does not tolerate waterlogging or infertile lateritic soils. Initial growth of the tree is rapid. At an age of 5 years, an average height of 13 meters with a bole diameter of 10cm is not unusual; after 10 years, 16.5 meters and 15 cm; after 20 years, 21.5 meters and 23.5 cm. After 15 or 20 years, growth slows down. In stands of 80-year-old trees, maximum height is about 45 meters, with a maximum diameter of 75 cm. The rotation period is approximately 80 years. The height of the tree at the moment of first flowering is important in silviculture. When it is long (it may reach up to 10 meters), the final bole form is positively affected, but early-flowering trees may develop extremely wide crowns and short boles. This characteristic is clearly undesirable in timber-crop species and warrants strong selection against flowering in conjunction with increased effort to develop commercial methods of vegetative propagation. The time of the 1st inflorescence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In Thailand, flowering normally starts at the age of 8 to 10 years. However, trees have been observed to flower at the age of 3 months, while a few specimens of superior phenotype did not flower until the age of 27 years. Flowers usually appear during the rainy season, and trees tend to flower synchronously. For plantations, stumps are planted at a spacing of 2 x 2 meters. As the tree is deciduous, raising pure plantations is discouraged; rather, it is recommended to raise 80% of mixed indigenous species and the remaining 20% teak. The average plantation yield in Java is 60 - 100 cubic meters/ha, including thinning. Occasionally the final harvest may yield as much as 390 cubic meters/ha in stands 80 years old. The mean annual volume increment is (min. 1) 3-6 (max. 15) cubic meters/ha. The root system is superficial, often no deeper than 50 cm, but the roots may extend laterally up to 15 meters from the stem. Young plants show a remarkable capability to recover after fire.', " +

The dye from the leaves prevents the blackening of yama after thay are cooked. The leaves are used for packing food products in the markets. An oil extracted from the seeds promotes hair growth. Sawdust from teakwood is used as incense in Java; the dust, however, may irritate the skin. The sawdust is also used to produce active carbon. The heartwood is often dull yellowish when freshly cut but turns golden brown or sometimes dark greyish-brown after exposure, often streaked grey or black; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 50mm thick band of yellowish-white or pale yellowish-brown sapwood. The grain is straight, wavy or slightly interlocked, with a rather coarse and uneven texture, growth rings are distinct. The wood is oily to the touch and when freshly cut has a smell reminiscent of leather. The wood is a medium weight timber that is rather soft, it is durable to very durable, with an average service life in contact with the ground of more than 10 years under tropical conditions and more than 25 years under temperate conditions. It dries well but rather slowly, rates of shrinkage are low, once dry it is very stable in service. It is not difficult to work, but requires some effort, mainly because of the presence of silica (up to 1.5%); stellite-tipped saws and tools tipped with tungsten carbide are indispensable for sawing and planing operations; it is difficult to chisel with a hollow square mortiser, but turns well; nail and screw-holding capacities are good, but pre-boring is recommended to avoid splitting; gluing is only successful on freshly machined or newly sanded surfaces. The wood bending properties are moderate; there is a tendency to buckle, and the wood is only suitable for bends of moderate curvature; painting, staining and polishing require freshly machined surfaces or a pretreatment with thinner, however it can be varnished and polished beautifully. Being classified as very resistant to teredo activity, the wood is an excellent timber for bridge building and other construction in contact with water such as docks, quays, piers and floodgates in fresh water. In house building, teakwood is particularly suitable for interior and exterior joinery (windows, solid panel doors and framing) and is used for floors exposed to light to moderate pedestrian traffic. It is also used quite extensively for garden furniture. Other uses are for building poles, transmission line poles, fence posts, wallboards, beams, woodwork, boxes, musical instruments, toys, railway sleepers and railcar construction.', " +
